# Fullstack Learning Path
This programme is divided into three steps: [frontend](#frontend), [backend](#backend), and [fullstack](#fullstack). Each part explores some library and/or frameworks by developing a stand-alone app that represent a significant project. The fullstack part brings previous parts together into a single fullstack application. In this process, the basic concept of fullstack development are introduced and discussed.

What follows is a detailed plan of the technologies to learn as well as the resources to be used to learn them. The programme is studied to be taken in the given order. However, more expert developers may want to skip some parts and favor others, feel free to use this programme in the way it most fits your needs.
